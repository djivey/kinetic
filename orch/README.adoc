== Orchestration States

These states can be used to control the lifecycle of your kinetic deployment

=== `zeroize.sls`

Called by `generate.sls`.
Can be used independently to rotate a single host type directly from the cli by passing manual pillar data in the form:

`salt-run state.orch orch.zeroize pillar='{"target":"controller-foobar"}'`

=== `map.sls`

Master orchestration state.
Completely wipes environment and starts fresh based on current mapping:

`salt-run state.orch orch.map`

=== `provision.sls`

Can be used independently.
Manages deployment of all host types on behalf of `generate.sls` and user calling

`salt-run state.orch orch.provision pillar='{"type":"cache"}'`

=== `generate.sls`

Can not be used independently.
Manages zeroization/provisioning of all host types on behalf of `map.sls`
